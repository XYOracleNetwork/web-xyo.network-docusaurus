# Start
Taking your first steps with XYO? Here's a few resources and demos to get you started on the right track.

## Your first node

The following CodeSandbox demonstrates a simple component that allows you to view an XYO Node.

A Node is a container that house Sentinels, Bridges, Archivists, and Diviners. (More on those, next!) 

Right now, the Node is empty and has a custom name. Try editing the name and see what happens!
