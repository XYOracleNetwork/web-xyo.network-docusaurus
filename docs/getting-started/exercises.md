# Exercises
Now that you've learned a little more about the components of the XYO Network and how it fits together in the XYO Platform, it's time for some demos!

These demos will expand your understanding of the XYO Platform, and introduce you to some new concepts.
## Resolve a Module
The interactive CodeSandbox demo below allows you to select an [XYO Module](/glossary) from a dropdown, and resolve it to see information about it.

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/witness-data-zzyddd?file=/src/App.tsx?codemirror=1&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&hidedevtools=1"
className="code-sandbox-div"
     title="Exercise 1 XYO Documentation"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

## Query a Node
Next, you can query an XYO Node.

className="code-sandbox-div"
     title="Exercise 1 XYO Documentation"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"

## Learn More
Explore public Archivists, browse demo dApps, or take a peek at the Glossary to learn more!

### Explore Public Data
We built [explore.xyo.network](https://explore.xyo.network) to make it easy to explore and interact with data on our public Archivist. (Fun Tip: Once you spin up your own Archivist, you can connect it & explore your own data!)

Here's some quick links:

- [Node Map for the XYO Main Network](https://explore.xyo.network/?network=main)
- [Activity on a World Map](https://explore.xyo.network/activity?network=main)
- [Payloads](https://explore.xyo.network/payload?network=main)
-[Schemas ](https://explore.xyo.network/schema?network=main)
### Demo dApps
The XYO Team has created a few demo dApps with real-world data to show you ways to utilize XYO Platform components. Use them to get your wheels turning on your own custom project, or just to browse!

- [In-Depth Explanations](/category/demo-dapps)
- [Browse on xyo.network](https://xyo.network/dapp)

Explore our demos on [xyo.network](https://xyo.network/dapp) or on our GitHub.

### Glossary
Need a quick reminder on what's what? The [Glossary](/glossary) can help you out!
