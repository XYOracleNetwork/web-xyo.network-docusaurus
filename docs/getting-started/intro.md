# Intro
Taking your first steps with XYO? Try out the following demo and read more about what XYO can do.

## Your first node

The following CodeSandbox demonstrates an XYO Node.

A Node is a container that house Sentinels, Bridges, Archivists, and Diviners. (More on those, next!) 

Right now, the `Node` is empty and has a custom name. Try editing `"YOUR-NODE-NAME"` and see what happens!

Next, try uncommenting the following lines of code:

 _Tip: All Modules in "yourModules" need a comma between them. Keep the leading comma in the Archivist Module line, otherwise you'll receive a bug!_

1. `Archivist` — An Archivist is where Bound Witness and Payload data is stored. A shared, hosted, or self-hosted archivist can be used. It is even possible to run an archivist on the same device as the Sentinel and Bridge.
2. `Witness` — A Witness captures real-world data.
3. `Bridge` — A Bridge transfers Bound Witness and payload data form Sentinels to an Archivist. In many cases, the same device that is running the Sentinel also acts as the Bridge.

A few other useful words to learn:

1. `Sentinel` — [TODO]
2. `Witness` — [TODO]
3. `Bridge` — [TODO]
