## XYO dApp Library
The [XYO dApp Library](https://xyo.network/dapp) is designed to showcase XYO Technology with real-world data behind it. The dApps include a [Token Price Aggregator](https://xyo.network/dapp/price-aggregator), a [Uniswap Pair Renderer](https://xyo.network/dapp/uniswap-pairs), and a [Gas Price Aggregator](https://xyo.network/dapp/gas-price-aggregator).

Each dApp aggregates data from multiple sources, creates Bound Witnesses with XYO Technology and secures that information in an Archivist.
