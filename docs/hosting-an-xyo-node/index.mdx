# Hosting an XYO Node

Hosting an XYO Node is very simple.  You may have already done so without even knowing it.  When you use a website that is powered by XYO, like Foreventory,
you are actually running an XYO Node in the Browser which is providing you with the functionality that you are using.

## Why host an XYO Node?

Even though using XYO enabled technology on the internet if effectively starting a Node, you may want to have a personal Node that not only can act as your
gateway to the Sovereign Internet, but also allows you to be part of the Sovereign Internet.  You can share content and data, on your terms, with friends or the public,
or you can have that Node do tasks for you while you are not at your computer.  You can even allow other people to use your Node to perform tasks for a fee.

## In Browser XYO Node

## Desktop XYO Node

## Mobile XYO Node

## Headless XYO Node

A headless XYO Node is run using NodeJS.  This means that it starts in the background and performs all its task without an explicit user interface.  You can however connect
to a headless XYO Node with a Node Viewer, like the [XYO Explorer](https://explore.xyo.network) of from another Node that you may be running.
