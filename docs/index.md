# What is XYO?
## Introduction
XYO is an open-source platform for creating and enhancing a software through data-based **sovereignty**, **provenance**, and **permanence**.

Encompassing both a network and protocol, XYO can be used for aggregating, verifying, organizing, and utilizing decentralized data from any hardware node capable of running XYO-enabled software or firmware. 

XYO’s defining premise is **decentralized verification**, allowing network devices to verify the data flowing into the network’s databases by acting as witnesses for one another, strengthening the veracity of data received. Simple, accessible organization then allows this data to be put to use quickly and efficiently.

## Examples of XYO
XYO is capable of processing any kind of decentralized data which can be generated, including location, user input, device interactions, and heuristics of all types. XYO’s network is also fully blockchain-enabled, allowing both data aggregation and storage to be fully decentralized if desired, although centralized data storage is also easily accomplished.
XYO is designed to be easy to implement, with several SDKs now available and an API soon to follow, allowing developers to tap into better decentralized data, and to realize the full power of the data their software aggregates, in a few simple steps.

## Advantages of XYO
XYO’s features include:
- **Optional Blockchain:** Whether you want to add a few decentralized plugins or completely re-vamp your project, XYO allows you to add just as much decentralization as you want. All XYO Modules have [sovereign](/glossary#sovereignty) ledgers, improving performance
- **Optional Blockchain:** Built-in data validation, helping to protect your data from both errors and attacks.
- **Optional Blockchain:** Optional, fully integrated blockchain functionality.
- **Optional Blockchain:** An easy-to-use, human-readable, JSON-based data structure for storage and organization.
